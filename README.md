cube-demo-go
============

A rotating wireframe cube, displayed with a HTML5 canvas, projection and rotation process done by a Go backend. 

This program has been developed to demonstrate a Raspberry Pi cluster, where the process is dispatched among the nodes.

This demo is based on the work of Leonel Machava : http://codentronix.com/2011/04/27/first-experiment-with-html5-a-wireframe-cube/
(it reminded me of one of my first "big" program when I was a teenager : a rotating wireframe cube in pascal and assembly language :) )
